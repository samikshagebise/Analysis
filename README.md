Analysis Overview :
This analysis aims to explore various aspects of loan default behavior, including how defaults vary across different demographic and financial features. The key components of the analysis are as follows:

1) Default by Age Bucket and Contract Type:
* The data has been segmented into different age buckets to analyze default rates across age groups.
* Default rates have also been examined in relation to different contract types to understand their impact on loan performance.
  
2) Threshold Analysis:
A maximum threshold has been established to tolerate loans within different categories, helping to identify outliers and high-risk segments.

3) Feature Distribution:
* The distribution of various features has been studied to understand their underlying patterns.
* Some features have been converted into deciles for simplified and more effective analysis.
  
4) Default Distribution Across Categories:
* Default rates have been analyzed across multiple categories to identify trends and correlations.
* The occupation type default distribution has been specifically examined to understand which job categories are more prone to default.
  
5) Financial Analysis:
* The relationship between default occurrence and different financial metrics, such as income and credit amount, has been analyzed.
* Each application ID has been scrutinized to determine the maximum loan amount borrowed and the duration of the loan.
  
6) Day Past Due Analysis:
The maximum days past due for each application have been calculated to identify patterns in payment delays.

7) Approval and Refusal Rates:
The ratio of approved to refused loans has been computed for each application.
