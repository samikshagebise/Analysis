* Analysis and Classification of Rice Plant Diseases :
 This project involves analyzing image data of rice plants to classify different diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network 
 (CNN) model. The goal is to help farmers accurately diagnose and treat rice plant diseases, thereby improving crop health and 
 yield.

Key Components:
* Image Data Collection:
Collected a diverse set of images depicting healthy and diseased rice plants from various sources.

* Data Preprocessing:
Applied preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model performance and robustness.

Model Architecture:
Designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for image classification tasks.
Utilized layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to extract features and classify diseases effectively.

*Training and Validation:
Trained the CNN model on a labeled dataset of rice plant images, with rigorous validation to ensure accuracy and prevent overfitting.
